TODO List App Description
This TODO List App is a simple web application that allows users to create, manage, and delete tasks.

### Features:
I added features like 
**Adding tasks**: this is done when users type in tasks in the input box and click the “Add” button added an if statement making sure empty inputs are not passed in as todos which triggers an alert reminding you empty inputs are not allowed
**Displaying tasks**: Added tasks are displayed as li’s with a border below separating them
**Marking tasks as completed**: A a line strikes through the marked task
**Deleting tasks**: i added an icon (X) for deleting the todo
**Local storage**: The app utilizes the browser's local storage to store the tasks as the page reloads. When tasks are added, marked as completed, or deleted, the changes are saved to the local storage. On page load, the tasks are retrieved from local storage and displayed to the user.
